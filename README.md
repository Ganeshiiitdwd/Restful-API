# Restful-API

This extensive backend project is developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, and various other technologies. It encompasses all essential features expected in a backend system. Our aim is to create a comprehensive video hosting platform akin to YouTube, complete with functionalities such as user authentication (login/signup), video uploading, engagement metrics (like/dislike, comment, reply), and subscription management.

We've adhered to industry-standard practices throughout, employing JWT, Bcrypt for password hashing, and implementing access and refresh tokens for secure authentication. Countless hours have been dedicated to crafting this project, and we're confident it offers an invaluable learning experience.
